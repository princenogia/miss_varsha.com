    			Miss Moon, real name is VARSHA, she has so many nicknames like MOON, PANDA, QUEEN RAIN, etc. She was born on 3rd December, 2003. She lives in Odissa with her family (a sweet little brother and her parents). She is bound to the rules that never let her fulfil her dreams. </p><br>

    			<p>She is actually really talented, smart, intelligent. She has always been a good student in school and right now as well she is one of the best and the bright student in the college. She always dreamt of becoming a doctor and one day she will be for sure. She is good in academics, study, singing (Never heard singing a song, but her voice is very melodious). 
    		</p><br>
    		<center><p>
    			She loves gaming, eating, listening music, roasting others (especially her friends), and sometimes studying (right before exams). She spend most of her time playing games like BGMI and COC and in the mean time she uses insta while listening songs. 
    		</p><br>
    		<p>
    			She is the prettiest and the most adorable girl. She is simple, quiet (in real life) and talkative (on social media). She is very caring and helping as she helps her parents and friends. She is never rude to anyone util anyone spoils her mood or make her angry, she is very-very friendly but after she gets angry it's better to keep a distance from her or else she will break that guy's face. She never asks for any help from anyone until and unless she fails to do that works or have problem in that. She has hell lot of friends but she also has an enemy that tease her and never let her to be happy it's none other than her internet. Whenever, she play games her internet creates a lot of touble during the match which she doesn't like, she is actually fed up of her internet but she can't leave him. She share everything with the one's that she trusts. She never break anyone's trust until the other guy does anything stupid. SHE IS THE BEST.
    		</p><br><br><br>

    		<u><h1>WHAT I FEEL FOR HER</h1></u>
    		<p>
    			First of all, she is my best friend. She talk to me daily whenever she is online. She is not just my friend, she is my everything. I found a love and friend in the same person. When i met her for the first time, she called me princess which i didn't like at all but then i got used to it. She is just so perfect that i can't even say anything or scold her for her mistakes because she never do any mistake. Since the day we started talking to each other, i never felt like i am alone or i don't have anyone to talk. She makes me happy whenever i am sad and always motivates me. Talking to her, gives some other kind of happiness. Without her i feel so lonely, when she is not online i am always worried about her. i am addicted to her, if even she is offline from past few minutes it feels like she is offline for days. I want her 24X7. I never even saw her photo, i just got aa glimps of her and i understood how she looks. She is realy pretty i can't even explain. She is such a nice person that i can blindly trust her because i know she will never break the trust, after all she knows all my secrets.<br>
    			We spent a lot of time together in chatting and playing games, spending time with her just makes my day. We play on weekends and it always feel like heaven when she is with me. She always share everything with me and i love to help her even if she doesn't say, i understand what's her problem. I never want her to take stress of anything or tension regarding any issue, i just want to be her joy, her entertainment. In short, i just want her to be happy always. I know sometimes the situation is like that i hurt her but still she forgive me, even if i make a mistake, she will ignore me for maximum upto 24 hours not more than that.<br>
    			I never actually think of irritatiog her, i just get little upset when she don't talk to me that's why i act childish which is really annoying for anyone. All i want is talking to her and spending time with her in game, that's my happiness. I only get angry on her when she says that she don't wanna talk to me or i irritate her. I still remember when she said,'I DON'T WANNA TALK TO YOU AND BLOCKING YOU'. This sentence literally made me cry like hell. When i feel like she is not in a good mood i become sad instead of making her laugh. I just don't wanna lose her at any cost because she is the only one who talk to me and understand me. I miss our old days when there was no misunderstandings, just faith. All i want from her is talking, spending time together in game and most importantly i want our friendship forever, i want to talk to her on call or just wanna hear her voice because listening to her voice makes me feel good and i also relax that she is fine.<br>
    			What happened if she don't like me and rejected me but i will be her friend always. You are my doraemon, my cute little angel.<br>
                I know i am not that much perfect, because i hurted her so much. I don't know for how long our friendship would be, all i know is that i never gonna get a friend like you that's why i don't wanna get away from you. Even the thought of losing you, scares th eliving daylights out of me. You are on my mind every second, i can't stop thinking about you. I wanna talk to you like old days, full of joy and happiness.
